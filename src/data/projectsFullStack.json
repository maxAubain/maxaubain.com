      "The goal of the application is to generate and show snapshots of webpages that are chosen by a user.  There is an input on the view for a user to specify the webpages with a list of URLs.  Upon submission of the URLs, the controller saves the URLs as a 'request' that can be retrieved later.  A Rails Gem helper method is used to generate screenshot image files for each URL address and they are stored on the back end in a File System configuration.  Finally, the request can be queried by the user in the view, where the URLs and screenshots associated with the query are displayed together.",
      "The application is configured to be run locally.  Instructions for generating a local build are included in the Github repository documentation."

Demonstration guides for this approach are found in the documentation of the 'github-client'.  The second approach includes creating a local build of the client.  This application was developed using TDD methods and, accordingly, acceptance tests are available on the client side.  It is not possible to test the api with its request specs due to security features implemented on the back end, but the request specs files are available for direct inspection in 'github-api'."
