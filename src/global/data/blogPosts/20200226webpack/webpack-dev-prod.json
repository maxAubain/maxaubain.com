      "paragraph": "Webpack [1] is an essential library used in the Node ecosystem, and integral with the optimizing and 'packaging' of static assets in the front end.  The library is a utility -- as in, it has various, but separate, uses throughout the application.  The value of its multiple functions are dependent on the context in which they are used, much like the various 'blades' of Swiss Army Knife are useful in opening cardboard boxes, filing nails, or unfastening a screw."

      "paragraph": "The two contexts which drive the configuration of Webpack are how the developer plans to use it development mode or production mode.  For example, an asset tree can be exported in a development build, which can help track and troubleshoot the location and hierarchy of assets.  However, revealing the asset tree in production would a major security vulnuerability.  Some of the fundamental Webpack tools and the contexts for their implementation will be discussed in detail later on."

      "paragraph": "While Webpack has many different types of tools, they all support static asset management.  What are static assets?  Fonts, stylesheets, images, pdfs, even React components... any file, element, or structure in the webpage DOM that is not expected to mutate once loaded on the webpage.  In the next two sections I will discuss how Webpack manages assets in development and production for website front end optimization and improvement of developer quality of life."

First, it uses minimization algorithms (essentially removing unsed characters in the code) so that each bundled asset is reduced in size, thus browser load time can be reduced.  Second, it allows for configuration of bundles, enabling certain assets to be bundled, and therefore loaded, together.  This second feature enables "
