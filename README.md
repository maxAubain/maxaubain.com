# Front End Application: Professional Portfolio
## Executive Summary
This repository stores a code base for a front end implementation of a porfolio that showcases my work history, skills, education, and web development projects.  The general app structure is organized around javascript ES6 compiling requirements and vanilla CSS.  The ReactJS library is used throughout the application to organize and display the information with stateful components.

## Deployment

## Design notes
The foremost requirement of the UI was to be 'mobile friendly'.  I relied upon this reference to learn about, and structure, CSS media queries: [Responsive design with html and css](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/).
