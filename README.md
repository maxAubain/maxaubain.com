# Front End Application: Professional Portfolio
## Executive Summary
This repository stores a code base for a front end implementation of a web development porfolio that showcases my experience, education, and projects.  The general app structure is generated using javascript ES8 compiling requirements and CSS3.  The ReactJS v16.9 is used to organize and display the information with stateful components in a "single-page" application framework.

### Developed by,

## Deployment
This [Professional Portfolio Application](https://maxaubain.com/) is deployed using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) webhosting services.

## Design notes
The foremost requirement of the UI was to be 'mobile friendly'.  I relied upon the following reference to implement CSS media queries: [Responsive design with html and css](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/).
